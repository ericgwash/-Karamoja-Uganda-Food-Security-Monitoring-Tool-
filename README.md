# -Karamoja-Uganda-Food-Security-Monitoring-Tool-
This repository contains an analysis assessing and visualizing the food security situation in the Karamoja region of Uganda. The study focuses on the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize). 




The dataset is categorised into shapefiles and tables. The shapefiles consist of the boundaries of Uganda Sub Counties and districts, and  crop-type maps for maize and sorghum. The two tables available are yield and population per Sub County and per District. The analysis will make it possible to develop a new food security monitoring tool to show visibility of the overall state of the region and offer reliable sources of information to guide decisions on matters prioritization of activities by NGOs giving technical support to the regionâ€™s farmers. Tableau software will be used to make this possible.  

# Project Description 
Karamoja [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamoja] is a region in the North-Eastern part of Uganda and is administratively divided into seven districts: Kaabong, Abim, Kotido, Moroto, Amudat, Napak and Nakapiripirit. The region has a cumulative population of 1,504,604 people on a land mass of 27,725,945,240 hectares. The area under crop cover is 147,662 hectares. 
For some time now, Karamoja has been the most food-insecure region of Uganda. This has been partly attributed to low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks. There are several NGOs that provide technical support as well as farm inputs to the farmers experiencing extremely low yields. The NGOs have been relying on very local sources of information in deciding on how to prioritize their activities. Such sources of information have often shared unreliable information to the NGOs and thus fail to have the true visibility of the overall state of Karamoja region. Therefore, this research seeks to develop an interactive visualization tool of the results of this first crop season.
 The dataset is categorised into shapefiles and tables. The shapefiles consist of the boundaries of Uganda Sub Counties and districts, and  crop-type maps for maize and sorghum. The two tables available are yield and population per Sub County and per District. This data is sufficient to meet the study objective. The assumption is that the data is credible and the population is current. 
 Through visualization, the study seeks to answer, among others, the following questions:
- What is the exact location of Karamoja region in Uganda on Map?
- Which districts have dedicated more land to farming of Maize and Sorghum?
- What percentage of the total area of each sub county has each crop (Maize and Sorghum) occupied?
- Display visualization of crop yield and productivity of districts or/and sub counties using different tools (charts/graphs)
- What is the per capita productivity of the Karamoja region?
- What is the potential productivity, actual and missed productivity in the region?

#  Technologies Used
Various Tableau visualization techniques 

# Usage
The visualization of results provided in this study will provide more reliable and reusable information by other NGOs and government agencies in making decisions on resource utilization and an understanding of the overall state of Karamoja region on maize and sorghum productivity. Any other similar data science project can adopt the analysis and visualization.
